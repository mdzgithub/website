- **Projects Page (projects.html)**: Showcase of personal and professional projects
- **404 Page (404.html)**: Custom error page for handling invalid URLs

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Features

- Clean, professional design with consistent styling
- Responsive layout that works on various device sizes
- Interactive elements including navigation buttons and project cards
- Skills displayed as visually appealing tags
- Modern, accessible typography and color scheme

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. No build process is required - this is a static website
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally
4. Deploy to any static web hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

## File Structure

```
├── index.html              # Home page
├── resume.html             # Resume/CV page
├── projects.html           # Projects showcase page
├── 404.html                # Custom 404 error page
├── resume-styles.css       # Shared CSS styles
├── counter.js              # JavaScript functionality
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Notes for Improvement

1. The JavaScript file `counter.js` currently only contains a test alert - it should be expanded to include actual functionality or removed.
2. The projects page contains placeholder content that should be replaced with actual projects.
3. Consider adding a contact form rather than just a mailto link.
4. Add a proper profile image instead of the placeholder.
5. Fix the border-radius in the 404 page (there's a typo in the CSS - `.5px` instead of `5px`).
